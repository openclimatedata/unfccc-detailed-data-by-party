* Updated data, the main website does not indicate a cutoff date for the included submissions. In addition to some new data, older data has been revised including removal of otherwise uncategorized data from "other" subcategories and recalculation of GWP weighted data.

### The following countries have additional or updated data (only non-AnnexI listed):
* Brazil has added data for 2016. Data for other years have been adjusted.
* Bhutan has added data for 2015.
* India has added data for 2016.
* Several countries have removed data from "other" subcategories. This usually affects the year 1994 where data were often put in "other" subcategories, likely because they didn't fit the IPCC1996 categories.
* For Afghanistan GWP weighted time-series have been adjusted.
* For Sierra Leone all data have been removed.
* For Pakistan all N2O and CH4 data have been removed.

### The following countries have additional or updated data (only non-AnnexI listed):
* Dominica has added data for 2006 - 2017
* Guyana has changed data for data presented in CO2 equivalents, e.g. all Kyoto GHG basket time series. Probably the underlying GWPs have changed. Be careful when using the data.
* Honduras has additional data for 2005 and 2015 for most but not all category and gas combinations
* Israel has added data for 2016 - 2018. Data for previous years have changed slightly for most sectors and gases.
* Maldives: added data for 2011 - 2015. Existing 2011 data points have changed while 1994 data have remained unchanged.

### The following countries have new or changed data:

* Bosnia and Herzegovina: new data for 2012 and 2014 for individual gases and for aggregate Kyoto gases complete new timeseries from 2001 to 2014. Data unchanged from 1990 to 2000.
* Chile: 2010, Kyoto GHG, category 2 datapoint that seemed erroneus in the last version has been corrected.
* Dominican Republic: Data for Year 2010 has been added.
* Ecuador: Data for 2012 has been added. Historical data has been changed (some data points have been removed). 1994 emissions are much higher than emissions for subsequent years.
* Guinea-Bissau: Data for Year 2010 has been added.
* Israel: Data for 2014 and 2015 has been added. Historical time series have been updated slightly.
* Republic of Korea: Data for 2013 and 2014 has been added. Historical CH4 time series have been updated and amended.
* Saint Lucia: Data for 2005 and 2010 has been added. Year 2000 data has been adjusted. 1995 emissions still very high compared to other years (originating from CH4, category 6 (waste)).
* Madagascar: Data for 2005 - 2010 has been added.
* Paraguay: Data for 2005,2012 has been added. 1994 data has been revised.
* Saudi Arabia: Data for 2012 has been added.
* Solomon islands: Data has been added for up to four years depending on gas and category. Only few data available for individual gases.
* Thailand: Data for Year 2014 has been added. For aggregate Kyoto GHG a complete  timeseries from 2000 to 2013 has been added.
* Viet Nam: Data for Year 2013 has been added.

Small changes in individual sectors might be missing as countries were only investigated in detail when changes were visible in aggregated Kyoto GHG data
(CATM0EL in [PRIMAP-hist](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/paris-reality-check/primap-hist/)).

### General problems

* Belize: Aggregate Kyoto GHG (CATM0EL in PRIMAP-hist) data does not coincide with calculated sums for years 2003, 2006, and 2009.
